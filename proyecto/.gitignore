# Project files to ignore in parent directories.
# These patterns assume the .gitignore is in D:\proyect\proyecto
# If the user is in a subdirectory, paths starting with ../ might be needed.
# However, for a root .gitignore, just the directory names are sufficient.

# Ignore files that are outside the current 'proyecto' directory, but were listed in git status.
# If these are part of a different project/repository, they should have their own .gitignore.
# For now, I'll assume they are temporary or related to the current context and should be ignored.
# This assumes that 'proyecto.sln' is the solution file for the current project.
# The 'SmallestPrimeNumber' project seems to be outside the current folder structure,
# I will only ignore files within the current 'proyecto' solution structure.

# Let's refine this to ignore only the build outputs within the current project structure.
# The 'modified' files like application/bin/Debug/net8.0/application.dll etc. will be ignored
# by the `bin/` and `obj/` rules.

# Ignoring the untracked parent directories `../say_hello/` and `../src/` might be too aggressive
# if they are actual source code directories that the user wants to commit.
# For now, I will only ignore the standard build output directories.
